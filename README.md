# CAPSTONE JAVASCRIPT PROJECT
This is the last project for the Zindua school module for Javascript.

## Project
My project is to create a simple hangman game. The game is basically guessing a word letter by letter. If the player fails to get the word in the set number of times, they lose. If the word is guesssed correctly, they win.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS and Javascript are the technologies used.
HTML is used for the structure.
CSS is used for the styling.
Javascript is used for the responsiveness.
